$ This is a sample stochastic algorithm output file,
$ which is a input for the simulator module.
$
$ This log file specifies the action to take in each state,
$ separate by space, : the action for state 0 is listed on the first
$ char, the action for state 1 on the second, and so on. For
$ state with no actions available, the corresponding char is
$ x.
$ actions are u d l r s and map to 0-3:
$ s u d r l
$ 0 1 2 3 4

$ Each record start with the time simulator write in.
