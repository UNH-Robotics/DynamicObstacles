$ This is a sample stochastic algorithm output file,
$ which is a input for the simulator module.
$
$ This file specifies the action to take in each state, one
$ per line, : the action for state 0 is listed on the first
$ line, the action for state 1 on the second, and so on. For
$ state with no actions available, the corresponding line is
$ left blank. Each return start with one line contain a char
$ "*" followed by the time that algorithm module write to this
$ file.
$ actions are u d l r s
